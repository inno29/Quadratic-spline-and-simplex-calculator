In this exercise I learned how to create a UI. I learned the different themes and how to output different outputs such as text, plots, tables, etc.
I also learned how to explore more on my own and self-learn. This exercise made me realize how fun it is to create UI's since it allows for the complex side of technology to communicate with those who are unfamiliar with its complexity.
